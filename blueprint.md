# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a multi-platform Flutter application with a user interface.

## Implemented Features

*   **Server Application:** A simple Dart server (to be replaced).

## Current Plan

1.  **Restore Flutter UI:**
    *   Modify `lib/main.dart` to create a visual Flutter application.
    *   Add `google_fonts` and `provider` packages for theming and state management.
2.  **Implement a Basic UI with Theme:**
    *   Create a `MyApp` widget as the root of the application.
    *   Implement a `ThemeProvider` to handle light/dark mode.
    *   Define a basic theme using `ColorScheme.fromSeed` and `google_fonts`.
    *   Create a home page with a title and some text.
3.  **Run the App:**
    *   Execute the application using `flutter run`.
4.  **Inform the User:**
    *   Notify the user that the app is running and should now have a user interface.
